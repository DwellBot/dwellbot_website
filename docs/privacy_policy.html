      "<strong>our</strong>") collects, uses, shares, and protects information when you use our websites, apps, and
      related services (collectively, the "<strong>Services</strong>"), including:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li><strong>DwellBot Games</strong> (our brand and related apps/experiences)</li>
      <li><strong>PlayClaw.Live</strong> (website and gameplay experience)</li>
    </ul>

    <p>If you have questions, contact us at <strong>privacy@dwell.bot</strong>.</p>

    <hr />

    <h3>Quick summary (plain English)</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>We collect information you provide (like your email), information from social login (Google/Facebook), and basic usage/device data to run and secure the Services.</li>
      <li>If you use real-time features (e.g., live video/audio, gameplay sessions), we process that data to provide the experience and keep it reliable and safe.</li>
      <li>We use <strong>Clerk</strong> for authentication, including Google and Facebook sign-in.</li>
      <li>We do not sell your personal information.</li>
      <li>You can request access, deletion, or correction of your data.</li>
    </ul>

    <hr />

    <h3>1) Who we are</h3>
    <p>
      <strong>Controller:</strong> Dwell Bot Inc. (DBA DwellBot Games)<br />
      <strong>Contact:</strong> privacy@dwell.bot<br />
      <strong>Mailing address:</strong> [Add your business mailing address]
    </p>

    <hr />

    <h3>2) Information we collect</h3>
    <p>
      We collect information in three ways: (A) what you provide, (B) what we receive from third parties (like social
      login), and (C) what we collect automatically.
    </p>

    <h4>A) Information you provide</h4>
    <p>Depending on how you use the Services, you may provide:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Account information:</strong> name, email address, username/handle, profile image.</li>
      <li><strong>Support and communications:</strong> messages you send us, feedback, bug reports.</li>
      <li><strong>Content you submit:</strong> any text, images, or other content you choose to upload or share through the Services.</li>
      <li><strong>Payment information (if applicable):</strong> if you purchase something, payments are typically handled by a payment processor; we generally do not store full card numbers ourselves.</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>B) Information from social login (Google/Facebook) via Clerk</h4>
    <p>
      If you choose "Sign in with Google" or "Sign in with Facebook," we receive limited profile information from those
      providers <strong>through Clerk</strong>, which may include:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Email address</strong></li>
      <li><strong>Name</strong></li>
      <li><strong>Profile photo (if available)</strong></li>
      <li><strong>Provider user ID / identifier</strong></li>
      <li><strong>Authentication metadata</strong> (e.g., sign-in timestamps; we do not receive your password)</li>
    </ul>

    <p>We use this information to create/manage your account and authenticate you.</p>

    <blockquote>
      <p>
        We do <strong>not</strong> post to your social accounts. We do <strong>not</strong> access your friends list or
        private messages unless you explicitly grant a permission and we clearly explain it at the time.
      </p>
    </blockquote>

    <h4>C) Information collected automatically</h4>
    <p>When you use the Services, we may automatically collect:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Device and network data:</strong> IP address, device type, operating system, browser type, app version, language, and approximate location (derived from IP).</li>
      <li><strong>Usage data:</strong> pages/screens viewed, gameplay/session events, features used, clicks, session duration, referrers, crash logs, performance diagnostics.</li>
      <li><strong>Cookies and similar technologies:</strong> for login/session management, security, preferences, and analytics (see Section 8).</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>D) Real-time features (if you use them)</h4>
    <p>
      Some Services may include real-time features (for example: live gameplay, livestream-style viewing, chat, or
      other interactive sessions). If you use these features, we may process:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Live video and images</strong> from game cameras and/or your device camera (if enabled)</li>
      <li><strong>Audio</strong> from your device microphone (if enabled)</li>
      <li><strong>Real-time messages/events</strong> (e.g., chat messages, control inputs, session state)</li>
      <li><strong>Connection/quality telemetry</strong> (latency, packet loss, connection status) to keep sessions working well</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      We use this data to provide the experience, prevent abuse/fraud, and maintain safety and reliability.
    </p>

    <hr />

    <h3>3) How we use information</h3>
    <p>We use information for the following purposes:</p>
    <ol>

      <li><strong>Security, safety, and integrity</strong><br />Detect, prevent, and respond to abuse, fraud, cheating, and unauthorized access. Enforce our terms and protect users and the public.</li>
      <li><strong>Improve and debug</strong><br />Measure performance, fix bugs, improve reliability and user experience.</li>
      <li><strong>Communicate with you</strong><br />Send service/transactional messages (e.g., verification, security alerts, important updates). Respond to support requests.</li>
      <li><strong>Comply with law</strong><br />Meet legal obligations and respond to lawful requests.</li>
      <li><strong>With your consent</strong><br />For optional features or marketing communications where required by law.</li>
    </ol>

    <hr />

    <h3>4) Legal bases (EEA/UK and similar regions)</h3>
    <p>Where applicable, we process personal data under these legal bases:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Contract:</strong> to provide the Services you request.</li>

      <li><strong>Consent:</strong> where required (e.g., certain cookies, optional marketing).</li>
      <li><strong>Legal obligation:</strong> to comply with applicable laws.</li>
    </ul>

    <hr />

    <h3>5) How we share information</h3>
    <p>We share information only as needed to operate the Services and comply with law.</p>

    <h4>A) Service providers (processors)</h4>
    <p>We use vendors to help us run the Services. Examples may include:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Authentication / identity:</strong> Clerk (user management, SSO)</li>
      <li><strong>Hosting / infrastructure / storage:</strong> [List your hosts/storage providers]</li>
      <li><strong>Analytics / monitoring:</strong> [List analytics/monitoring providers]</li>
      <li><strong>Customer support tools:</strong> [List support providers, if any]</li>
      <li><strong>Payments (if applicable):</strong> [List payment providers]</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      These providers are authorized to process personal data only as necessary to provide services to us and are
      required to protect it.
    </p>

    <h4>B) Social login providers</h4>
    <p>
      If you choose Google or Facebook sign-in, those providers may receive information about your use of their login
      features. Their handling is governed by their own privacy policies.
    </p>

    <h4>C) Legal, safety, and enforcement</h4>
    <p>We may disclose information if we believe it is reasonably necessary to:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Comply with law, regulation, legal process, or governmental requests</li>
      <li>Enforce our terms and policies</li>
      <li>Protect the rights, property, and safety of users, DwellBot, and the public</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>D) Business transfers</h4>
    <p>
      If we are involved in a merger, acquisition, financing, reorganization, bankruptcy, or sale of assets,
      information may be transferred as part of that transaction, subject to standard confidentiality protections.
    </p>

    <h4>E) With your direction</h4>
    <p>
      We share information when you instruct us to do so (for example, integrating with a third-party app you
      connect).
    </p>

    <p>
      <strong>We do not sell your personal information.</strong><br />
      We also do not share personal information for cross-context behavioral advertising in the way certain laws define it.
    </p>

    <hr />

    <h3>6) Data retention</h3>
    <p>
      We retain personal data only as long as needed for the purposes described in this Policy, including:

      <li>Security and fraud prevention</li>
      <li>Compliance with legal obligations</li>
      <li>Resolving disputes and enforcing agreements</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Examples:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Account data:</strong> retained while your account is active and for a limited period after deletion where necessary for legal, security, or fraud-prevention purposes.</li>
      <li><strong>Logs/security data:</strong> typically retained for a limited period (often days to months) unless needed for investigations.</li>
      <li><strong>Real-time session data:</strong> processed to provide the session; if we store recordings or replays, we retain them until you delete them or for a limited period based on product needs and legal requirements.</li>
      <li><strong>Backups:</strong> may persist for a limited time even after deletion, then are overwritten.</li>
    </ul>

    <hr />

    <h3>7) Security</h3>
    <p>
      We use reasonable administrative, technical, and organizational safeguards designed to protect information
      (e.g., encryption in transit, access controls, least-privilege practices, monitoring). No method of
      transmission or storage is 100% secure, but we work to protect your data.
    </p>

    <hr />

    <h3>8) Cookies and similar technologies</h3>
    <p>We use cookies and similar technologies for:</p>
    <ul>

      <li><strong>Preferences:</strong> saving settings such as language or gameplay preferences</li>
      <li><strong>Analytics:</strong> understanding usage and improving the Services</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      You can control cookies through your browser settings. Some features may not function properly if you disable
      essential cookies.
    </p>

    </ul>

    <hr />

    <h3>9) International data transfers</h3>
    <p>
      If you access the Services from outside the United States, your information may be processed in countries with
      different data protection laws. Where required, we use safeguards such as standard contractual clauses.
    </p>
