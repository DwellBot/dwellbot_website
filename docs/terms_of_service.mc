## 5) User content

### 5.1 Your content
“**User Content**” means any content you submit, upload, stream, or otherwise make available through the Services (e.g., chat messages, photos, profile images, clips you upload).

You retain ownership of your User Content, but you grant DwellBot a license to use it as described below.

### 5.2 License to DwellBot
To operate the Services, you grant DwellBot a worldwide, non-exclusive, royalty-free, sublicensable, and transferable license to host, store, reproduce, modify (for technical purposes, e.g., formatting), transmit, display, perform, and distribute your User Content **solely**:
- To provide and maintain the Services
- To improve reliability, prevent abuse, and enforce policies

- To create aggregated or anonymized analytics

This license ends when you delete the content or your account, except where:
- Content has been shared with others and they have not deleted it
- We must retain it for legal, security, or fraud-prevention reasons
- It exists in backups for a limited time

### 5.3 Your responsibilities
You represent that you have all rights necessary to submit User Content and that it does not violate law or third-party rights. You are responsible for your User Content.

We grant you a limited, revocable, non-exclusive, non-transferable license to use the Services for your personal, non-commercial use, subject to these Terms.

If the Services offer paid features (e.g., credits, subscriptions, premium queue access, or in-game items):

- **Pricing and taxes:** Prices may change. Taxes may apply.
- **Billing:** Payments are processed by third-party processors. You agree to their terms as well.

### 10.1 By you
You may stop using the Services at any time. You may request account deletion by contacting **privacy@dwell.bot**.

### 10.2 By us
We may suspend or terminate your access to the Services at any time if we reasonably believe:
- You violated these Terms or our policies
- Your use poses a security, safety, or legal risk
- Your use harms other users or the Services

We may also terminate or discontinue the Services at any time.

### 10.3 Effect of termination
Upon termination, your right to use the Services ends. Sections that by their nature should survive termination will survive (e.g., IP, disclaimers, limitation of liability, dispute terms).

---

## 11) Disclaimers

THE SERVICES ARE PROVIDED **“AS IS”** AND **“AS AVAILABLE.”** TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, DWELLBOT DISCLAIMS ALL WARRANTIES, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, AND NON-INFRINGEMENT.

TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, DWELLBOT’S TOTAL LIABILITY FOR ANY CLAIM ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THE SERVICES WILL NOT EXCEED THE GREATER OF:
- **$100**, OR
- THE AMOUNT YOU PAID DWELLBOT (IF ANY) FOR THE SERVICES IN THE **12 MONTHS** BEFORE THE EVENT GIVING RISE TO THE CLAIM.

Some jurisdictions do not allow certain limitations, so some of the above may not apply to you.
