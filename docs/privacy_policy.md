## 2) Information we collect

We collect information in three ways: (A) what you provide, (B) what we receive from third parties (like social login), and (C) what we collect automatically.

- **Support and communications:** messages you send us, feedback, bug reports.
- **Content you submit:** any text, images, or other content you choose to upload or share through the Services.
- **Payment information (if applicable):** if you purchase something, payments are typically handled by a payment processor; we generally do not store full card numbers ourselves.

If you choose “Sign in with Google” or “Sign in with Facebook,” we receive limited profile information from those providers **through Clerk**, which may include:
- **Email address**
- **Name**
- **Profile photo (if available)**
- **Provider user ID / identifier**
- **Authentication metadata** (e.g., sign-in timestamps; we do not receive your password)

We use this information to create/manage your account and authenticate you.

> We do **not** post to your social accounts. We do **not** access your friends list or private messages unless you explicitly grant a permission and we clearly explain it at the time.

We use this data to provide the experience, prevent abuse/fraud, and maintain safety and reliability.
